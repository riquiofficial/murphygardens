Murphy Gardens Website

A website for Murphy gardens created by RQ Web Development.

Built for a local business. No javascript, no frameworks, just HTML and CSS/SCSS. For this project I really wanted to push the boundaries of CSS, and by doing so, learned both its strengths and limitations. Consent was given to display on my portfolio/github.
